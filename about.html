            <h1>About</h1>
            <pre><p>                Welcome to the digital realm of Tor, where creativity meets technology, and imagination knows no bounds. I am a digital artist whose journey began in 2020,
                driven by a passion for blending traditional artistic techniques with the limitless possibilities of the digital world.Early Inspirations
                and Artistic Evolution. My journey into the world of digital art was not a straightforward one. Growing up on Planet 404, I was always
                fascinated by the vibrant colors and intricate designs I saw in nature and the world around me. My early years were spent dabbling in various
                forms of traditional art, from sketching and painting to sculpture. However, it was the discovery of digital art during my teenage years that
                truly ignited my passion. The transition from traditional to digital was a turning point in my career. The ability to manipulate colors,
                shapes, and textures without the constraints of physical media was exhilarating. I found myself exploring Figma, constantly learning and
                evolving my style. Technique and Style. My art is characterized by its vibrant colors, intricate details, and a blend of surrealism and
                realism. I draw inspiration from a wide range of sources, including nature, mythology, and science fiction. Each piece I create is a journey
                into a fantastical world, crafted with meticulous attention to detail. I primarily work with Figma, using a combination of digital painting,
                3D modeling, and photo manipulation to bring my visions to life. The process is both intuitive and methodical, allowing me to experiment while
                maintaining a high level of precision and quality. Achievements and Exhibitions Over the years, I have been fortunate to showcase my work
                in various exhibitions and digital art forums. Highlights of my career include being named "Artist of the Month," where my work was
                recognized and appreciated by peers and art enthusiasts alike. I have also collaborated with various brands and organizations, creating
                unique digital artworks for campaigns, websites, and publications. These collaborations have not only been a source of professional growth
                but have also allowed me to push the boundaries of my creativity.</p></pre>
